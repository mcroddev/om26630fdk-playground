## Introduction

This project serves as a hands-on exploration of the features and capabilities
of the [NXP OM26630FDK evaluation board](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards-and-designs/OM26630FDK).
It is developed entirely from the ground up, without relying on any vendor-provided
code from NXP or ARM. The long-term goal is to create a reusable CLRC663 driver
that can be easily integrated into other projects, along with PC software
similar to [NFC Cockpit Configuration Tool for NFC ICs](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards-and-designs/nfc-cockpit-configuration-tool-for-nfc-ics:NFC-COCKPIT)
to interface with the evaluation board and explore the full capabilities of the
CLRC663.
